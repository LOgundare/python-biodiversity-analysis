# Biodiversity Analysis
## Overview
For this project, I will interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.

I will perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, I will analyze, clean up, and plot data as well as pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.

After I perform my analysis, I will share my findings about the National Park Service.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on two csv.files:
**species_info.csv**: Contains details about species (common name, scientific name, category, and conservation status. 
**observations.csv**: Contains species observation counts across diferent national parks.

[View all data files](./Data/)

## Key Questions
1. What is the distribution of species across different national parks?
2. Which species are most commonly observed in each parks?
3. Which categories of species are most at risk of endangerment?
4. Which national park has the highest number of endangered or threatened species?
5. Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- PowerPoint (for data storytelling)

## Methods
- Data wrangling wih Pandas
- Exploratory visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps)
- Statistical significance test

## Results
- Vascular Plants, Birds, and Mammals have the highest number of at-risk species.
- The most endangered species include bats (myotis) and ospreys.
- Statistical analysis showed a significant relationship between species category and conservation status.

## Limitations
•	Simplified species name classification using last-word extraction
•	Observations do not represent population sizes
•	Dataset reflects a limited time snapshot (2015–2017)
•	Assumptions of chi-square test may not hold for small categories
